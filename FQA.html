Meditation is a conscious effort to change how the mind works. The Pali word
for meditation is 'bhavana' which means 'to make grow' or 'to develop'.</span></p>

Yes, it is. No matter how much we may wish to be good, if we cannot change the
desires that make us act the way we do, change will be difficult. For example,
a person may realize that he is impatient with his wife and he may promise
himself: &quot;From now on I am not going to be so impatient.&quot; But an hour
later he may be shouting at his wife simply because, not being aware of
himself, impatience has arisen without him knowing. Meditation helps to develop
the awareness and the energy needed to transform ingrained mental habit patterns.</span></p>

To live, we need salt. But if you were to eat a kilogram of salt it would kill
you. To live in the modern world you need a car but if you don't follow the
traffic rules or if you drive while you are drunk, a car becomes a dangerous
machine. Meditation is like this, it is essential for our mental health and
well-being but if you practice in a stupid way, it could cause problems. Some
people have problems like depression, irrational fears or schizophrenia, they
think meditation is an instant cure for their problem, they start meditating
and sometimes their problem gets worse. If you have such a problem, you should
seek professional help and after you are better then take up meditation. Other people
over reach themselves, they take up meditation and instead of going gradually,
step by step, they meditate with too much energy for too long and soon they are
exhausted. But perhaps most problems in meditation are caused by ''kangaroo
meditation'. Some people go to one teacher and do his meditation technique for
a while, then they read something in a book and decide to try that technique,
then a week later a famous meditation teacher visits town and so they decide to
incorporate some of his ideas into their practice and before long they are
hopelessly confused. Jumping like a kangaroo from one teacher to another or
from one meditation technique to another is a mistake. But if you don't have
any severe mental problem and you take up meditation and practice sensibly it
is one of the best things you can do for yourself.</span></p>

The Buddha taught many different types of meditation, each designed to overcome
a particular problem or to develop a particular psychological state. But the
two most common and useful types of meditation are Mindfulness of Breathing
(anapana sati) and Loving Kindness Meditation (metta bhavana).</span></p>

You would follows these easy steps: the four Ps place, posture, practice and
problems. First, find a suitable place, perhaps a room that is not too noisy
and where you are not likely to do disturbed. Second, sit in a comfortable
posture. A good posture is to sit with your legs folded, a pillow under your
buttocks, your back straight, the hands nestled in the lap and the eyes closed.
Alternatively, you can sit in a chair as long as you keep your back straight.
Next comes the actual practice itself. As you sit quietly with your eyes closed
you focus your attention on the in and out movement of the breath. This can be
done by counting the breaths or watching the rise and fall of the abdomen. When
this is done, certain problems and difficulties will arise. You might
experience irritating itches on the body or discomfort in the knees. If this
happens, try to keep the body relaxed without moving and keep focusing on the
breath. You will probably have many intruding thoughts coming into your mind
and distracting your attention from the breath. The only way you can deal with
this problem is to patiently keep returning your attention to the breath. If
you keep doing this, eventually thoughts will weaken, your concentration will
become stronger and you will have moments of deep mental calm and inner peace.</span></p>

It is good to do meditation for 15 minutes every day for a week and then extend
the time by 5 minutes each week until you are meditating for 45 minutes. After
a few weeks of regular daily meditation you will start to notice that your
concentration gets better, there are less thoughts, and you have moments of
real peace and stillness.</span></p>

Once you are familiar with Mindfulness of Breathing and are practicing it
regularly you can start practicing Loving Kindness Meditation. It should be
done two or three times each week after you have done Mindfulness of Breathing.
First, you turn your attention to yourself and say to yourself words like
&quot;May I be well and happy. May I be peaceful and calm. May I be protected
from dangers. May my mind be free from hatred. May my heart be filled with
love. May I be well and happy.&quot; Then one by one you think of a loved
person, a neutral person, that is, someone you neither like nor dislike, and
finally a disliked person, wishing each of them well as you do so.</span></p>

If you do Loving Kindness Meditation regularly and with the right attitude, you
will find very positive changes taking place within yourself. You will find
that you are able to be more accepting and forgiving towards yourself. You will
find that the feelings you have towards your loved ones will increase. You will
find yourself making friends with people you used to be indifferent and
uncaring towards, and you will find the ill-will or resentment you have towards
some people will lessen and eventually be dissolved. Sometimes if you know of
someone who is sick, unhappy or encountering difficulties you can include them
in your meditation and very often you will find their situation improving.</span></p>

The mind, when properly developed, is a very powerful instrument. If we can
learn to focus our mental energy and project it towards others, it can have an
effect upon them. You may have had an experience like this. Perhaps you are in
a crowded room and you get this feeling that someone is watching you. You turn
around and, sure enough, someone is staring at you. What has happened is that
you have picked up that other person's mental energy. Loving Kindness
Meditation is like this. We project positive mental energy towards others and
it gradually transforms them.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
A teacher is not absolutely necessary but personal guidance from someone who is
familiar with meditation is certainly helpful. Unfortunately, some monks and
laymen set themselves up as meditation teachers when they simply don't know
what they are doing. Try to pick a teacher who has a good reputation, a balanced
personality and who adheres closely to the Buddha's teachings.</span></p>

Yes, it is. Meditation is now accepted as having a highly therapeutic effect
upon the mind and is used by many professional mental health workers to help
induce relaxation, overcome phobias and bring about self-awareness. The
Buddha's insights into the human mind are helping people as much today as they
did in ancient times.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>What is Buddhism?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Buddhism is a religion to about 300 million people around the world. The word
comes from 'budhi', 'to awaken'. It has its origins about 2,500 years ago when
Siddhartha Gotama, known as the Buddha, was himself awakened (enlightened) at
the age of 35.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>Is Buddhism a Religion?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
To many, Buddhism goes beyond religion and is more of a philosophy or 'way of
life'. It is a philosophy because philosophy 'means love of wisdom' and the
Buddhist path can be summed up as:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>(1) to lead a moral life,<br>
(2) to be mindful and aware of thoughts and actions, and<br>
(3) to develop wisdom and understanding.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>•<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>How Can Buddhism Help Me?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Buddhism explains a purpose to life, it explains apparent injustice and
inequality around the world, and it provides a code of practice or way of life
that leads to true happiness.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>•<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Why is Buddhism Becoming Popular?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Buddhism is becoming popular in western countries for a number of reasons, The
first good reason is Buddhism has answers to many of the problems in modern
materialistic societies. It also includes (for those who are interested) a deep
understanding of the human mind (and natural therapies) which prominent
psychologists around the world are now discovering to be both very advanced and
effective.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>Who Was the Buddha?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Siddhartha Gotama was born into a royal family in Lumbini, now located in
Nepal, in 563 BC. At 29, he realised that wealth and luxury did not guarantee
happiness, so he explored the different teachings religions and philosophies of
the day, to find the key to human happiness. After six years of study and
meditation he finally found 'the middle path' and was enlightened. After
enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life teaching the principles of
Buddhism — called the Dhamma, or Truth — until his death at the age of 80.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>Was the Buddha a God?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
He was not, nor did he claim to be. He was a man who taught a path to
enlightenment from his own experience.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>Do Buddhists Worship Idols?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Buddhists sometimes pay respect to images of the Buddha, not in worship, nor to
ask for favours. A statue of the Buddha with hands rested gently in its lap and
a compassionate smile reminds us to strive to develop peace and love within
ourselves. Bowing to the statue is an expression of gratitude for the teaching.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>Why are so Many Buddhist
Countries Poor?</span></b><span style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";
color:black'><br>
One of the Buddhist teachings is that wealth does not guarantee happiness and
also wealth is impermanent. The people of every country suffer whether rich or
poor, but those who understand Buddhist teachings can find true happiness.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>Are There Different Types of
Buddhism?</span></b><span style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
There are many different types of Buddhism, because the emphasis changes from
country to country due to customs and culture. What does not vary is the
essence of the teaching — the Dhamma or truth.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>Are Other Religions Wrong?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Buddhism is also a belief system which is tolerant of all other beliefs or
religions. Buddhism agrees with the moral teachings of other religions but
Buddhism goes further by providing a long term purpose within our existence,
through wisdom and true understanding. Real Buddhism is very tolerant and not
concerned with labels like 'Christian', 'Moslem', 'Hindu' or 'Buddhist'; that
is why there have never been any wars fought in the name of Buddhism. That is
why Buddhists do not preach and try to convert, only explain if an explanation
is sought.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>Is Buddhism Scientific?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Science is knowledge which can be made into a system, which depends upon seeing
and testing facts and stating general natural laws. The core of Buddhism fit
into this definition, because the Four Noble truths (see below) can be tested
and proven by anyone in fact the Buddha himself asked his followers to test the
teaching rather than accept his word as true. Buddhism depends more on
understanding than faith.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>What did the Buddha Teach?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
The Buddha taught many things, but the basic concepts in Buddhism can be summed
up by the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>What is the First Noble
Truth?</span></b><span style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
The first truth is that life is suffering i.e., life includes pain, getting
old, disease, and ultimately death. We also endure psychological suffering like
loneliness frustration, fear, embarrassment, disappointment and anger. This is
an irrefutable fact that cannot be denied. It is realistic rather than
pessimistic because pessimism is expecting things to be bad. lnstead, Buddhism
explains how suffering can be avoided and how we can be truly happy.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>What is the Second Noble
Truth?</span></b><span style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
The second truth is that suffering is caused by craving and aversion. We will
suffer if we expect other people to conform to our expectation, if we want
others to like us, if we do not get something we want,etc. In other words,
getting what you want does not guarantee happiness. Rather than constantly
struggling to get what you want, try to modify your wanting. Wanting deprives
us of contentment and happiness. A lifetime of wanting and craving and
especially the craving to continue to exist, creates a powerful energy which
causes the individual to be born. So craving leads to physical suffering
because it causes us to be reborn.</span></p>

Truth?</span></b><span style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
<br>
The third truth is that suffering can be overcome and happiness can be
attained; that true happiness and contentment are possible. lf we give up
useless craving and learn to live each day at a time (not dwelling in the past
or the imagined future) then we can become happy and free. We then have more
time and energy to help others. This is Nirvana.</span></p>

The fourth truth is that the Noble 8-fold Path is the path which leads to the
end of suffering.</span></p>

In summary, the Noble 8-fold Path is being moral (through what we say, do and
our livelihood), focussing the mind on being fully aware of our thoughts and
actions, and developing wisdom by understanding the Four Noble Truths and by
developing compassion for others.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>What are the 5 Precepts?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
The moral code within Buddhism is the precepts, of which the main five are: not
to take the life of anything living, not to take anything not freely given, to
abstain from sexual misconduct and sensual overindulgence, to refrain from
untrue speech, and to avoid intoxication, that is, losing mindfulness.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>What is Karma?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Karma is the law that every cause has an effect, i.e., our actions have
results. This simple law explains a number of things: inequality in the world,
why some are born handicapped and some gifted, why some live only a short life.
Karma underlines the importance of all individuals being responsible for their
past and present actions. How can we test the karmic effect of our actions? The
answer is summed up by looking at (1) the intention behind the action, (2)
effects of the action on oneself, and (3) the effects on others.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>What is Wisdom?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Buddhism teaches that wisdom should be developed with compassion. At one
extreme, you could be a good hearted fool and at the other extreme, you could
attain knowledge without any emotion. Buddhism uses the middle path to develop
both. The highest wisdom is seeing that in reality, all phenomena are
incomplete, impermanent and do not constitute a fixed entity. True wisdom is
not simply believing what we are told but instead experiencing and
understanding truth and reality. Wisdom requires an open, objective, unbigoted
mind. The Buddhist path requires courage, patience, flexibility and
intelligence.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>What is Compassion?</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'><br>
Compassion includes qualities of sharing, readiness to give comfort, sympathy,
concern, caring. In Buddhism, we can really understand others, when we can
really understand ourselves, through wisdom.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white'><b><span
style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>How do I Become a Buddhist?<br>
</span></b><span style='font-family:"Tempus Sans ITC";color:black'>Buddhist
teachings can be understood and tested by anyone. Buddhism teaches that the
solutions to our problems are within ourselves not outside. The Buddha asked
all his followers not to take his word as true, but rather to test the
teachings for themselves. ln this way, each person decides for themselves and
takes responsibility for their own actions and understanding. This makes
Buddhism less of a fixed package of beliefs which is to be accepted in its
entirety, and more of a teaching which each person learns and uses in their own
way.</span></p>
